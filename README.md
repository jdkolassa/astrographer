# Astrographer #

A small little plugin to demonstrate coding abilities to potential employers. It is both a plugin and a theme that requires the plugin. 

The actual plugin will show data on real, actual, astronomical stars from the Hipparcos Catalog,the Yale Bright Star Catalog (5th Edition), and the Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars (3rd Edition). To see the original data, go to https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database. Many thanks to David Nash (https://github.com/astronexus) for providing this information on GitHub.
